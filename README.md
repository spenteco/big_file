# big_file

A repo for testing Git Large File Storage (LFS).

# Process

**Created this repo**, and cloned it to my workstation.

**Followed the instructions** at https://git-lfs.github.com/  The instructions say to run a command like

> git lfs track "*.psd"

Instead, I did:

> git lfs track "big.xml"

**Created test files**, one big and one little XML file.

**Added, commit, push**.
